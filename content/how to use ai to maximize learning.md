AI is a tool that can help you learn even better and it can help you avoid learning even better.

## Heuristics to improve learning with AI

- Actively engaging, wresting, recalling and making connections is where learning happens, not just passively intaking information
- Use AI for curation (what to read, where to look), not conclusions (what to believe)
- Learn [[metaskills]] that will still be useful as AI gets better (evaluating ai trustworthiness, noticing when something doesn't fit, asking good questions, coming up with new creative uses)
- Rely on AI more for orienting knowledge and less for developing [[deep taste]]
- Orienting knowledge can be accelerated with AI without much loss
	- AI is generally pretty trustworthy on basic orienting knowledge cause there is a lot of training data
	- Also, can be verified fairly easily by others (although you would still have to actually do this)

## Risks of using AI to learn

- It replaces your learning and all you've actually learned is how to tell AI to do the thing. You haven't internalized any taste about it.
- If the AI is your only source of knowledge of a thing, it's very brittle. AIs can get things wrong. Or err on the side of consensus. Or not know when to nuance something.

## Questions

- When are AI summaries worth the trade off?
