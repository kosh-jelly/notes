### [[Level 2 Retreat POGW]]

4 immeasurables (benefits and number of beings benefited by these are immeasurable):
From the [[brahma vihara]] sutras
In mahamudra it's from the lotus sutra
Asanga wrote about it in the filigree of the Mahayana

1. Equanimity - impartiality toward all beings  Even mindedness Free of judgements and categorizing Impartiality (like the sun shining equally on everyone)  Near enemy: indifference/apathy equanimity always has a quality of feeling  Opposite: Reactivity  (Dukka reactivity is the fundamental reactivity of the mind. This kind of reactivity is down the line.) 
2. Loving kindness (unconditional love) - unconditional openness and positivity toward all beings  Far Enemy: Hatred Near Enemy: Clingy love / conditional Love / Self-centered love  
3. Compassion - a response to suffering of others  Far enemy: Malice Near enemy: Pity (self creates separation, feeling sorry for someone) 
4. Sympathetic Joy (Joy for Others) - taking joy in the gains of others  Near Enemy: Self-Centered Joy  wifi shirt example - we want to be joyful for others, but we make it more about us than about them  Far Enemy (Opposite): Envy & Jealous  Envy - Coveting something somebody else has Jealousy - Fear something you have will be taken by somebody else)
