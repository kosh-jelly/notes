## Strategies

- Ask the model to assume your project has failed and evaluate for weaknesses
- Ask one model to verify the output of another model
	- prompt: Evaluate this response -- what's wrong? What's missing?

## Tools

- [notebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)
- Use projects in ChatGPT and Claude to upload research papers or books and query them
- [Zotero MCP Server](https://github.com/54yyyu/zotero-mcp) that you can query for any papers in Zotero using Claude
	- I use this with Claude (very cool and helpful!)
