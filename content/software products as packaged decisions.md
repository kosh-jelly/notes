## Core Idea

Currently, average computer users might use AI for googling, or may even chat with ChatGPT, but they're not using apps to make them personalized software. 

Current bottlenecks:
- Awareness
- Articulation
- Access
- Trust
- Maintenance

Soon, AI will get good enough at writing personalized software that creating it becomes trivially easy. What bottlenecks will not be solved so easily?

- Awareness - still has to think, "oh yeah I could do that with my AI"
- Articulation - will get a lot easier, but AI can only make what you can describe
- Trust - Is it made correctly and securely? Is it actually doing the thing I want it to do (for things where verification is not trivial)
- Motivation - still has to want to make a change or adapt to a new way of doing things

In this world, [[products are a set of prepackaged decisions]]. Making all the decision is the hard part. The coding part of the product is a commodity (no longer a value proposition).

Where the value of future software lies:
- products that take their specific needs into account: _"We understand your specific situation better than you could explain it to a general AI."_
	- A user might not articulate "I want a morning briefing that understands the cognitive patterns of someone managing a parent with dementia," but if that product exists and someone recommends it to her, she'd see the value instantly.
- taste: a strong philosophy about what works best as part of what you're buying into
	- e.g. Superhuman email system incorporates a philosophy of how to do email. Things is built on the GTD philosophy.
- trust: it just works. I don't have to configure it and troubleshoot it.
- proprietary data that's not accessible automatically to the big models (network effects)
	- e.g. data from family members, friends, neighborhood, school, etc...
