# deep taste

**Summary:** 

## Core Idea



Taste is something that's developed from being deeply immersed into a subject for a long period of time. Having deep taste means you can do things like know how much to weight different ideas, know how they connect to other possibilities and hypotheses, know how different people in the field might respond and critique. 

Deep understanding (thinking with concepts, applying them, critiquing them) requires mental work, wrestling, and engagement, not just passive intake. Develop this through struggle, friction, and error correction.

Generating sentences to describe something, asking questions about disagreements in a field, recall ideas and relating them to other ideas helps.

## Levels of taste


- **Deep taste** (1-2 areas in a lifetime?): Dissertation-level. You become someone others consult.
- **Working taste** (5-10 areas in a lifetime?): Clinically competent judgment. You can evaluate claims and notice when something doesn't fit.
- **Map-level knowledge** (everything else): Can look things up, know what you don't know.


## Questions

- can you develop deep taste in more areas? Seems like Tyler Cowen is someone who has deep taste a very wide variety of subjects. What does it take to develop deep taste in a wide variety of subjects? Maybe extensive reading and learning? Is that possible for us meer mortals that aren't Tyler Cowen?
- Right now AI is not good at deep taste, but people are actively working on training it. Will it eventually become better at deep taste than us?

## Connections

- Relates to [[how to use ai to maximize learning]] because AI summaries are great for map-level general knowledge, and may lead you astray on developing deep taste
- Contrasts with [[]] in that
